 * Changes:
 * --------
 * 05-Aug-2002 : Version 1, contributed by Richard Atkinson;
 * 09-Oct-2002 : Fixed errors reported by Checkstyle (DG);
 * 10-Apr-2003 : Replaced reference to CategoryDataset with
 *               KeyedValues2DDataset (DG);
 * 23-Apr-2003 : Switched around CategoryDataset and KeyedValues2DDataset
 *               (again) (DG);
 * 13-Aug-2003 : Added clone() method (DG);
 * 14-Jun-2004 : Removed clone() method - classes that implement the interface
 *               should implement the PublicCloneable interface instead,
 *               wherever possible (DG);
 * ------------- JFREECHART 1.0.x ---------------------------------------------
 * 02-Feb-2007 : Removed author tags from all over JFreeChart sources (DG);
 * 13-Dec-2007 : Updated API docs (DG);
