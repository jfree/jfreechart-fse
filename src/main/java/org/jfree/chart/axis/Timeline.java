/**
 * An interface that defines the contract for a Timeline.
 * <P>
 * A Timeline will present a series of values to be used for an axis. Each
 * Timeline must provide transformation methods between domain values and
 * timeline values. In theory many transformations are possible. This interface
 * has been implemented completely in
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.axis.SegmentedTimeline}.
 * <P>
 * A timeline can be used as parameter to a
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.axis.DateAxis} to define the values that this axis
 * supports. As an example, the {@link org.jfree.chart.axis.SegmentedTimeline}
 * implements a timeline formed by segments of equal length (ex. days, hours,
 * minutes) where some segments can be included in the timeline and others
 * excluded. Therefore timelines like "working days" or "working hours" can be
 * created where non-working days or non-working hours respectively can be
 * removed from the timeline, and therefore from the axis. This creates a smooth
 * plot with equal separation between all included segments.
 * <P>
 * Because Timelines were created mainly for Date related axis, values are
 * represented as longs instead of doubles. In this case, the domain value is
 * just the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT as
 * defined by the getTime() method of {@link java.util.Date}.
